This repo reflects my work for the fulfillment of Free Code Camp's intermediate front end development project: Show the Local Weather.  The following user stories were to be met:

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
